Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Jinko API Cookbooks! Your contributions help make our documentation and examples better for everyone.

To maintain a high standard and ensure consistency across all cookbooks, please follow these guidelines when contributing:

### 1. Use the basic model

 -  Copy this basic [template](./cookbooks/basics/template.ipynb) to initialize a new cookbook.

### 2. Create an MR Per Cookbook

- Each contribution should be made as a separate Merge Request (MR).
- This allows for easier review and ensures that changes are focused and isolated.

### 3. One Cookbook = One Use Case

- Each Jupyter Notebook (cookbook) should focus on a single, well-defined use case.
- Avoid combining multiple use cases into one notebook.

### 4. Keep It Light and Simple

- Aim to keep the examples straightforward and easy to understand.
- Avoid adding unnecessary complexity.

### 5. Comment and Illustrate with Real Use Cases

- Provide clear and concise comments within the code to explain the steps and logic.
- Illustrate each use case with real examples using the Jinko API.

### 6. Focus on Illustrating API Usage

- The primary goal is to demonstrate the use of the Jinko API.
- Avoid adding too many additional functions or helpers that detract from the main purpose.
